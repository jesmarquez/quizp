This files describes API changes in the quizp code.


=== 3.0.3 ===

* mod_quizp\output\edit_renderer::start_section_list now takes $structure as an
  argument. If you have overridden this method (it's hard to believe anyone ever
  would) you will need to update your renderer.

* Several methods relating to preview links/buttons/urls have a new optional
  argument to make the preview be of a particular variant.


=== 3.0.1 ===

* quizp_attempt::question_print_comment_fields() has been removed. It was broken
  since at least Moodle 2.0.


=== 2.9 ===

* There have been changes in classes/output/edit_renderer.php for MDL-40990.
  + Some methods use to take $structure & $question as the first two arguments.
    They now take $structure & $slot number. If you need $question, you can get
    it using $question = $structure->get_question_in_slot($slot);
  + Some methods used to take $quizp & $question. They now take $structure & $slot
    number. You can get $question as above. $quizp is $structure->get_quizp().
  + initialise_editing_javascript has had some redundant arguments removed.
  Hopefully, with these changes, we will have less need to make other changes in future.

* Due to MDL-40992, you should be aware that extra slots can get added to an attempt.
  You may get slot numbers beyone the end of the original quizp layout, and you
  may want to call $attemptobj->get_original_slot to find where the question
  originally came from.

* You now need to pass an instance of the mod_quizp_renderer if you call
  $attemptobj->render_question or $attemptobj->render_question_at_step.

* The array values in mod_quizp_links_to_other_attempts may now be either a moodle_url,
  or renderable (or null). Previously they could only be a moodle_url or null.

* The contents of the navigation block is now not just quizp_nav_question_button-s.
  It can also contain quizp_nav_section_heading-s. If you have overridden
  mod_quizp_renderer::navigation_panel, then you may need to account for this.
  This change also has implications for the Edit quizp page.


=== 2.8 ===

* Classes that were defined in various lib files have been moved to the classes
  folder to take advantage of auto-loading. This has involved renaming them.
  see the list in mod/quizp/db/renamedclasses.php.

* The quizp no longer handles its own \mod_quizp\event\attempt_becameoverdue event,
  and so the event handler function quizp_attempt_overdue_handler has been deleted.
  Also, the internal function quizp_send_overdue_message has add the arguments
  changed. It now takes the $attemptobj object, not separate stdClass objects.

* Major changes to the Edit quizp page.

  The goal of this work was to increase usability, and also clean up the page
  enough that it will be possible to add new features in future.

  Display of mod/quizp/edit.php is now entirely generated by
  mod_quizp\output\edit_renderer. This uses a helper class mod_quizp\structure
  to provide details of the structure of the quizp, and mod_quizp\repaginate to
  alter that structure. (Actually, there are still some modification methods on
  mod_quizp\structure. Expect that to be cleaned up in future.)

  The new code uses much more ajax, and there are new scripts mod/quizp/edit_rest.php
  and mod/quizp/repaginate.php to handle this. (Again, don't be surprised if those
  two scripts get merged in future.) Also questionbank.ajax.php (which may, in
  future, be made more generic, and moved into the core question bank code.)

  As a result of this, mod/quizp/editlib.php has gone. (A few remaining functions
  were moved to locallib.php.)

  Here is a list of all the old functions or classes that have changed.
  If you used any of these in custom code, you will need to update your code.
  (Note that many of these functions should have been considered private internals
  of the quizp module, and you should not have been using them!)

  From editlib.php:
      quizp_remove_slot
      quizp_delete_empty_page
      quizp_add_page_break_after_slot    - Use methods of structure or repaginate
      quizp_update_slot_maxmark          - classes instead.
      _quizp_move_question
      quizp_move_question_up
      quizp_move_question_down

      quizp_print_question_list
      quizp_print_pagecontrols
      quizp_print_singlequestion         - Use methods of edit_renderer instead.
      quizp_print_randomquestion
      quizp_print_singlequestion_reordertool
      quizp_print_randomquestion_reordertool
      print_random_option_icon
      quizp_print_grading_form
      quizp_print_status_bar

  Moved from editlib.php to locallib.php:
      quizp_question_tostring - now always returns a string (the only option used).
                               The $return argument has gone.

  Old editing JavaScript (e.g. mod/quizp/edit.js) is gone. Replaced with YUI modules.


=== 2.7.1 ===

* The function quizp_fire_attempt_started_event has been removed. This function
  should not have been used outside the quizp, but if you were using it, you should
  trigger the event outside this function. Note that the appropriate start event is
  fired automatically by the quizp_attempt_save_started function.

=== 2.7 ===

* The old quizp.questions database column (comma-separated list of question ids)
  is gone, and instead the quizp_question_instances table has been renamed to
  to quizp_slots. Some of the columns of that table have been renamed to match
  the coding guidelines. Specifically:
      quizp     -> quizpid
      question -> questionid
      grade    -> maxmark
  also there are two new columns:
      slot     -  numbers the questions in the quizp in order, as on the edit quizp page.
      page     -  new way to determine which question is on which page.
  naturally, other parts of the code and APIs have been updated to reflect that
  change.

* The following functions, which were part of the internal workings of the quizp,
  have been removed.
      quizp_get_slot_for_question
      quizp_number_of_questions_in_quizp
      quizp_repaginate               (there is now a quizp_repaginate_questions with a different API).
      quizp_add_page_break_at        (see quizp_add_page_break_after_slot)
      quizp_add_page_break_after     (see quizp_add_page_break_after_slot)
      quizp_number_of_pages
      quizp_remove_question          (see quizp_remove_slot)
      quizp_update_question_instance (see quizp_update_slot_maxmark)

* The following internal functions have had their API changed.
      quizp_delete_empty_page: has had its arguments changed to $quizp and $pagenumber.
      quizp_has_question_use: now takes $quizp and $slot, not $questionid.

=== 2.6 ===

* As part of improving the page usability and accessibility, we updated the
  heading levels for quizp module so it has a proper nesting. (MDL-41615)

* mod_quizp_renderer::view_best_score has been removed. (It did not do what the
  name suggested anyway.)


=== 2.4 ===

* mod_quizp_renderer::finish_review_link now requires $attemptobj to be passed in
  instead of a moodle_url.


=== Earlier changes ===

* Were not documented in this way. Sorry.
