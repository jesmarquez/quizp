This files describes API changes for quizp report plugins.

Overview of this plugin type at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Quiz_reports
=== 2.6 ===

* Improving the display page and heading levels to have a proper nesting.
We are reducing the amount of white spaces for the top report by making
'separate group' options and attempts to be displayed inline.
In grading report, we are changing 'no questions' from using heading to
notification message. (MDL-41615)

=== 2.3 ===

* Support for the old way of doing cron in a separate cron.php file has been removed.
Instead, you need a lib.php file inside the plugin with a cron function
called quizp_myreportname_cron(). The statistics report is an example of how
it should be done.

* There was a big refactor of the quizp reports, in issues MDL-32300, MDL-32322 and MDL-3030.
It is difficult to explain the changes. Probably the best way to understand what
happened is to look at
    git log mod/quizp/report/overview
    git log mod/quizp/report/responses
and so on. Here are some notes on a few of the changes:

The class quizp_attempt_report was renamed to quizp_attempts_report (with an extra s).

Some globally defined constants with the prefix QUIZP_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ moved into
the quizp_attempts_report class. Specifically

quizp_attempts_report::ALL_WITH         replaces QUIZP_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ALL
quizp_attempts_report::ENROLLED_ALL     replaces QUIZP_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ALL_STUDENTS
quizp_attempts_report::ENROLLED_WITH    replaces QUIZP_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH
quizp_attempts_report::ENROLLED_WITHOUT replaces QUIZP_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH_NO

Your if you have a table class, it needs to be renamed like
quizp_report_myreportname_table -> quizp_myreportname_table. That is, all the
class names in your plugin should start with the frankenstyle plugin name
quizp_myreportname.


=== 2.2 ===

* Plugins should be converted to implement cron in the standard way. In lib.php,
define a
function quizp_myreportname_cron() {};
This replaces the old way of having a separate cron.php file. Also, the cron
frequency should be defined in version.php, not in the quizp_reports table.


=== earlier versions ===

* ... API changes were not documented properly. Sorry. (There weren't many!)
